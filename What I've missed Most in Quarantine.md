I've been thinking recently about what I miss most during this period of Self-Isolation and I think generally I've been doing okay without in-person interaction for the most part.
The main thing that I've been lacking is music, any kind of musical interaction with other people.
I really like to sing but moreso I like to sing with other people and over the internet you can't achieve low enough latency to sing in sync, and the same goes for dancing.

I miss singing and dancing with and for people.
