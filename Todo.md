# Todo
+ This is the app that manages the tasks which you must complete
+ Do I want a todo app separate from Notion?
	+ Probably
+ If I timeblock, then I don't need a separate todo
+ but if I use a todo maybe I use the [kitchen method](https://youtu.be/cWW7Q4eJr8w?t=468)
	+ I don't think this would be very helpful for school work, but maybe for personal things front/backburner could work
		+ Maybe I use notion for school todo and then something like todoist for my own projects
		+ So every time we get homework it goes in the notion database and then I have a scheduled time to do homework and study where I do that
			+ **I like this**
	+ I could use front and back burners in Notion too
+ [Plan](https://getplan.co/) seems like a good tool for if I do want something outside of notion
	+ Another option is just entirely ignoring notion for task and only using it as a workspace and note taking platform
	+ And with that using plan exclusively for tasks or something similar
		+ This may be more difficult within school
+ I might just need to try multiple things out when I'm actually back in school
