The concept of Police is often taken for granted in our modern society but our ideas of their necessity has been often challenged in the recent few months with many demands to defund or abolish police being amplified by major news outlets. (Despite the fact that these ideas are not new.)

I don't know yet if I agree with the concept that the police are entirely obsolete, but it's definitely a system that has its roots in oppression and continues to be used in that way today.

The police's current purview extends far past what any logical person would assign to the concept of a *crime* policing authority. Along with that, the concept of the police deterring crime just simply isn't true based on how many of the most committed crimes are done out of some form of necessity rather than 
nefariousness. (E.g. Theft/Drugs which are usually not preplanned or considered)

Along with that the force of police is used instead of any form of rehabilitation for most drug addicts - as if addiction is something that needs to be *punished* rather than helped.
