# Transient Notes
+ These are the opposite of [[Evergreen Notes]], they are scraps of uncurated thoughts made in the moment or made to work for one specific purpose
+ an example would be any of my daily notes ([[2020-08-20]])
+ Another would be [[Flintstones Smartwatch]] which would probably mean very little in a year, but is still somewhat interesting as a concept that could be refined
+ Andy Matuschak advised having some sort of inbox with a spaced repitition system to filter through transient notes and process them into trash and evergreens, though I don't think that is the system I'll use for now
