I've found a lot of enjoyment and calmness in activities which limit my inputs, more specifically *automated* inputs.
By this I mean things like youtube, discord, anywhere that gives me new input without my "permission".
Examples of things without this are Reading Books, [[Yoga]], Meditation, and exercise.
This limiting of inputs can be very helpful and I think even when I'm doing "unproductive" things I should remember to limit my inputs to heighten enjoyment. I would like to mostly watch things on youtube that I *decide* to watch, rather than things suggested to me. I have a video queue, I have a reading queue in notion and I should use them
