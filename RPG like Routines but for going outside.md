# RPG Thingy

kinda like that other thing called Routines
by Janie Jaffe W
#### The Game
	
	A single-player mech game to play while coding.
	Inspired by not being able to focus, while coding.


	Before you start, choose an objective. It could be writing out a certain part of assignment, or fixing a particular problematic section of code. Make it something you can achieve in one sitting.


	begin()
	You are a pilot of a K-Series Enhanced-Armored Battlemech. While some mechs interface with their pilots through neural uplink, or clunky joysticks, K-series mechs are designed to be controlled solely through typing on a keyboard. K-series pilots write long routines that are then interpreted by the mech’s decision core. In action, this enables a dance with pilots activating, monitoring, and rewriting code on the fly, a constant algorithmic conversation, as beautiful and efficient as it is deadly. In downtime, this means long hours in the hangar lounge, writing plans to ensure you’re ready for the next battle, whenever it may be.


	What does your mech look like? Picture them in your head.
	What do you call your mech? Why?


	You are not allowed to see your mech when there is no emergency. Another group of technicians handles their maintenance. You must focus on the routines. 
	You send them over airwaves every time you save. 


	Start writing your code. These will be your routines. Their quality will determine how you fare.

	You can leave messages for your mech, hidden as comments among the lines of code. What do they say? Does your mech ever respond? Are they even processed when compiled in the mechs decision core?

	Whenever you finish a single routine (function, class, block of code), think of a new detail of your mech, or your relationship with them. /*Texture, color, taste, where you met, the sound of the joints, your first mission, when you thought they were lost*/




	If you take a break, there is a false alarm. Your squadron is deployed, but there was no attack, only a faulty radar sensor. With no routine to guide you, where does your mech take you? How do you spend your fleeting time together?


	If you run a debugger, you are piloting a simulator. You are not in your mech, but in a sterile and precise approximation. What is different? What is missing? Do you think of them?


	Once you finish enough code to test, it is time for a battle. 
	A fight has arrived, whether you want one or not. Hope that you are prepared.


	Run your code. 


	Then, check the list below to determine the results of the battle.
	* If your code worked perfectly with no bugs…
	you and your mech fought flawlessly together. What extra thing did you achieve in the battle? /*Capture an important enemy or position, catch the eye of a superior officer, grow closer with your mech, something else*/ How do you feel about this?
	* If your code compiled and ran, but did not work correctly…
	The battle was hard won. You are successful, but barely. What did you lose in the attack? /*Control of someone/somewhere, respect of a superior officer, a bond with your mech, something else*/ How do you feel about this? 
	* If your code crashed…
	You crashed. Hard. In the middle of an active battlefield. Is your mech still functional? Are you hurt? How will you get out of here? How do you feel about this?


	No matter the results, ask yourself if you have the will to press on. 
	If you do, get back in your mech and keep writing. 
	If not, set aside your keyboard and retire for now.


	If you achieve your objective, congratulations.
	Your war is over, for now.
	Think on what you have gained and what you have lost.
	Was it worth it?



#### Thoughts

Ok so I've had more developed ideas on this, and I think I could tie it in with like litter collection/recycling maybe

The idea is that you like walk around an urban-ish area which is going to fill the role of the post-apocalyptic world you inhabit, and as you recycle things you find irl you create details of what they were in universe, where they came from and how scavenging them helps you.
Then maybe you can keep these things consistent (e.g cigarette butts are always some kind of battery)

I maybe have similar ideas with this and like cleaning a world of magic and cleansing and auras and stuff

---
Maybe another thing where you're some kind of alchemist/witch/brewer finding different plants and animals in nature?
There's a lot of ideas here.

Want to use maybe a glass jar (repurposed mayonaise/nutella) to pick up the small pieces of rubbish
