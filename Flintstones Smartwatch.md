# Flintstones Smartwatch
This idea really just sparked that interested part of my brain, it was a collaborative idea in the SHR discord, search flintstones to find source.

The idea was essentially that making a system neutral smartwatch would be really interesting and how it would manifest in magic in more arcane settings.
But the idea came up that in Flintstones it could be like a bird on your wrist telling you the time, and more features (complications) would be like more small animals on your arm, texting could be some messenger pigeon, maybe there's a groundhog telling you the weather etc.
Eventually your arm becomes covered in animals and you become a [[Techno-Druid]]
