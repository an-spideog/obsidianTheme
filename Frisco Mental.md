This is where you see every teamfight as winnable even in situations where it seems like it could be snowballed easily, but this isn't reckless feeding or staggering.

It's about recognising and planning your win conditions, backing at the right times, and then re-engaging with a target in mind and the knowledge that you *can* win.
