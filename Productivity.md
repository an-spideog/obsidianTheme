# Systems
+ Habits are important
+ [[Goals Vs Systems]] explains why systems are more important than goals
	+ [[Focusing on the Inputs]] is a similar point but I heard it separately
+ [[Time Management vs Energy Management]] discusses the system of managing your energy instead of managing your time


# Habits
+ [[The 2 Minute Rule]] - Forming habits under 2 minutes long
+ [[The 1 Minute Rule]] - This is a habit I'm trying to build (is under the 2 minute mark, of course) 
+ The [[5 Hour Rule]] is 1 hour per day, so it's not under 2 minutes but I'm not struggling too much with trying to maintain it so far
+ [[Sometimes it's okay for me to take a break]] - This is a very *very* important habit, don't forget to take breaks



# Working Tools
+ [[Coworking]] wouldn't be considered a tool by many but is in fact a useful asset in motivation and accountability
+ [[Calendar]], [[Todo]], [[Notes]], [[Email]] are all self-explanatory

# Thoughts 
+ [[Work vs Exploration]] is me thinking about what I consider "Productive" and whether everything I consider as such is also "Work"
