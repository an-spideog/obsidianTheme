# Goals Vs. Systems
+ Goals are temporary, the output of "Clean your room" is a clean room, but only until it gets messy again because of your lack of cleaning
+ However if you change your habits (input), *the system*, then your room will stay clean.
+ This is very reminiscent of [[Focusing on the Inputs]]
