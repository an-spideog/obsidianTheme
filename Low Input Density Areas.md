My room for work has a high input density, lots of things, lots of things *to be done*.
If I move to the garden or the kitchen there is a lower input density, I like it there. 

[[Trying to Limit Inputs]] about mental input
This reminds me of ideas CGP Grey discussed on relay.fm/cortex

Update to this: Cleared my room to try and create lower input density.
