# How should we interact with teens and children in online spaces
+ Long title, but I think it's something that needs to be discussed
+ Children can be mistreated and especially taken advantage of in online spaces if not acknowledged properly
+  but excluding children outright is (I think) a non-option
	+ Similarly to how criminalising prostitution doesn't actually stop it, this won't stop kids from being in internet spaces, it simply means that they will be hidden and won't be able come forward about issues relating to that without also being banned or otherwise excluded
+ Relating again to the concept of banning children from online spaces is that as a child on the internet I found it to mostly be a welcoming and very informative environment, it opens up many possibilities for socialising and learning both of which of course come with risks
+ It's, of course, important to think about how NSFW topics are discussed within public access servers for children, which ultimately all discord servers are
	+ While there can be certain places online which have the specific purpose of educating youths about this sort of thing, it should not be considered within the rights of users to discuss it with random users unless they know for certain that user's age
