# 5 Hour Rule
+ The five hour rule says you should dedicate 1 hour a day 5 days a week purely to learning
+ The concept is that you spend this time learning then you will reap the rewards as your life goes on
---
+ It is relevant to note that the core concept that is used to market this idea (that it turns ordinary pepole into "successful people" is obviously flawed)
	+ People who have enough time to learn 5 hours a week in a fashion unrelated to their main job or education are already successful and stable people who likely are supported by their family or generational wealth
___
+ I want to make sure I mostly use it to learn things outside of my school syllabus or even my planned career path, 
	+ Maybe music theory?
	+ Maybe design?
