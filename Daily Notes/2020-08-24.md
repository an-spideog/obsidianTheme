# 2020-08-24
+  Writing more info on [[How should we interact with teens and children in online spaces]]
+  I think I want Progress/Status Tags e.g
	+  #Seedling
	+  #Tree
	+  #Evergreen 
+  It's important to remember that MOCs aren't exclusive or defining, I can put one page in multiple MOCs
	+  [[Mental]] can be in [[Health]] and [[eSports]]

+  Remember that evergreen means notes can be revisited and especially *revised*, it's ok to change them



 ## New MOCs
---
+ [[Productivity]]
+ [[RPG]]
+ [[Media]]
+ [[Knowledge]]
+ [[Society and Politics]]
+ [[Health]]
+ [[Learning]]
+ [[Organisation]]
