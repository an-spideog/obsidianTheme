# Daily Note
+ Still thinking about my [[Todo]]
+ I'm wondering whether I want a calendar like notion or if I want a separate more detailed thing that's less of a calendar and more of a "schedule"
+ Notion would hold abnormalities and the schedule would have the typical day/week including school classes
+ Schedule would say "Homework"
	+ But notion would have the actual homework
		+ test
+ I want to set up some more notion dashboards, just so that I'm always ready to use them
