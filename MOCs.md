# Maps of Content
+ Maps of content are a method of organising notes within a knowledge vault, they are in someways "hierarchical" but do not strictly order your notes
+ They instead place a view over your notes from which you can access them, so no hierarchy is actually implemented, rather a facade of hierarchy like a workbench upon which your tools rest
+ There are three stages of implementing a Map of Content
	+ The first is collecting things to put on your "workbench"
	+ The second, and main step is curating and managing those notes using this perspective to give you insight, you can arrange them as you see fit and combine or divide them as you do it
	+ The third step is a continuation of the second because MOCs continue to grow as you use them, but you use it as a way to access your notes, especially as your vault scales
+ ~~In this setup you only start linking notes outside of MOCs if they are [[Evergreen Notes]]?~~
	+ Not wrong but mostly not relevant√í
