# Evergreen Notes
+ Evergreen notes from what I can tell, are notes that are designed to stay relevant, and because of that are more refined and curated
+ An example of an evergreen note would be [[Yoga - The Edge]], it is specific and relevant only to itself and doesn't rely on another note to derive meaning
+ It is concept oriented, atomic, and densely linked
+  Evergreen notes can be made by combining, curating or editing [[Transient Notes]]
